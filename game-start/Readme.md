## Game instructions

Start by taking a look at the hangman starter code. Work with your engineering mentor to go over the core concepts of how it works.

Things to touch on before moving on: 
* What is a variable, how are they created
* How functions work
* How if statements can make different things happen
* How to read info from HTML using jQuery
* How to add stuff back to the page
* How random() works
* How the HTML is set up

Once you've been introduced to these topics, and opened the page in a web browser, dive in to playing around with the code.

Working with your mentor, finish off the handleGuess() function so that it checks what the user types.

Once that's working decide if you want to continue improving your hangman game or if you want to move on to tic-tac-toe.

### Hangman improvements

There are a couple ways to build on your hangman game, start with whatever sparks your interest and play around with the game as long as you'd like. Here's a few ideas to get started:

#### Game rules
* Add a button to show all the missing vowels in your word
* Add a time limit to complete the game
* Add a difficulty selector and show different words based on what the user chooses

#### Polish
* Add styling to change the fonts, colors, and look of your game
* Change the game over message to show up on the page instead of in a pop-up
* Allow the user to replay the game after winning / losing
* Give the user a score based on the number of wrong guesses (you can show high scores if you've implemented the previous bullet)

## Tic-Tac-Toe

Open the tic-tac-toe starter page in a web browser and take a look at the code.

With your engineering mentor, discuss the basics of arrays and loops to get a handle on how it works.

Decide what changes you want to make to the code; here are some ideas to get you started:

#### Game rules
* Change the win condition so the first player to get 3 in a row loses
* Change the size/shape of the board
* Add an additional player with a new letter

#### Polish
* Add styling to change the fonts, colors, and look of your game
