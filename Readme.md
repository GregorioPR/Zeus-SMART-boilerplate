# Zeus SMART Instructions

Welcome to the Zeus SMART hack-a-thon. Today you'll be working with a Zeus engineer to create your own website or game.

## Setup

1. Go to this page and sign up for a free github account: https://github.com/join
2. Fork the starter repository found here: https://github.com/raynor/Zeus-SMART-boilerplate
3. Clone the repository to your local machine, for a cheat sheet of git commands, see docs/git-help.md

We've prepared two different tracks for you to choose depending on what you find more interesting. In the website track you'll design and build a simple webpage that we'll show you how to publish online. In the games track you'll build off of a starter kit for a game hangman or tic-tac-toe, learning how to customize it and make things move on the web. If you need help deciding, taking a look through each track's instructions may be helpful.

## Build your own  website

### Design

Spend a few minutes brainstorming ideas for a webpage. Take a look at the examples for inspiration; some other ideas to consider might be a page advertising a club or organization you're part of or a simple blog layout to voice your opinions. 

Once you've decided on an idea, think about what your site should look like. It can be helpful to look at websites similar to what you're trying to build and copy how the elements are arranged for your page. Draw out a basic layout on paper, creating boxes for where the major sections should be and draw lines for headings and paragraphs.

### Code

Go over the starter code with your engineering mentor in bidiusl and open index.html in a web browser. 

Work with your mentor to decide how to structure your code based on the wireframe you drew up. Try and split your site up into a few independent sections that you can tackle one at a time. Set up empty containers in your HTML for each of the sections, and any code needed for the overall structure of your layout, then go through the following steps for each of them:

#### HTML

Fill in the content for your section including any images and text. Work with your engineering mentor to get the HTML set up in a way that will be able to be styled easily down the line.

Note for mentors: It's a good idea at this point to decide whether it makes sense to use bootstrap on the site depending on how easily the overall layout will fit into its grid system.

If your section has a lot of text, you can use a [lorem ipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com/) to fill in placeholders for now; you can find free images to use on your site at the following places:

* https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/ 
* https://unsplash.com/ 
* https://pixabay.com/
* https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/


Don't worry too much at this stage about finding the perfect image for your design, but it's good to get something on the page first so you can tweak and improve down the line.

#### Styling

Start customizing the look and feel of your content using tachyons and custom css if needed. It can be helpful to look at online inspiration at this point and use the inspector tool of your browser to see the css rules they use. 

It's suggested that you do this in multiple passes, getting basic styling for each of your sections done before going back to refine your design.

#### Polish & Expand (Optional)

If you have time and you feel satisified with how your site looks, you can use any remaining time up to the final 15 minutes (if you want to publish) to tweak and fill in your content and add whatever enhancements you'd like. A few ideas of things you could add are:

* Customize the mouse cursor
* Animate any links or buttons when the mouse is hovered over
* Change the tab icon that appears in the browser

Don't feel pressure to complete this step if you'd rather spend more time styling and tweaking the look of your website. 

#### Publish (Optional)

If you want to make your page publicly viewable on the web, work with your engineering mentor to push the changes you worked on up to github. Once your changes are in your repository, go to the repository settings and set the github pages option to 'master branch'. To change the url of your repository, rename it in the github settings. Your website will be published at https://yourusername.github.io/projectname

Spend any time you have left tweaking your site, adding content, and getting ready to show it off.
